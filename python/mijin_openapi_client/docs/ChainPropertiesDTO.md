## Example

```python
from mijin_openapi_client.models.chain_properties_dto import ChainPropertiesDTO

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ChainPropertiesDTO from a JSON string
chain_properties_dto_instance = ChainPropertiesDTO.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(ChainPropertiesDTO.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
chain_properties_dto_dict = chain_properties_dto_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ChainPropertiesDTO from a dict
chain_properties_dto_from_dict = ChainPropertiesDTO.from_dict(chain_properties_dto_dict)
